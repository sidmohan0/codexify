# Development Notes

## Checkpoint 1 (Dec 30, 2024)

### Completed Features
1. Basic Electron app setup with:
   - Document processing pipeline
   - Vector embeddings using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - SQLite database for storage
   - Basic search functionality
   - Collection management
   - Drag-and-drop file handling

2. UI Improvements:
   - Added semantic highlighting for search results
   - Implemented collection deletion
   - Added shadcn/ui components
   - Set up Tailwind with proper theming

### Open Items/Decisions

1. **Database Strategy**
   - Current: SQLite with JS-based vector similarity
   - Alternative Options:
     - DuckDB with native vector operations (faster but less stable)
     - ChromaDB (more features but heavier)
     - PostgreSQL with pgvector (more robust but requires server)

2. **UI Framework Migration**
   - Current: Mixed HTML/JS with some React components
   - Options:
     - Full React migration
     - Keep hybrid approach
     - Stay with vanilla JS/HTML

3. **Search Optimizations**
   - Implement ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
   - Add metadata filtering
   - Improve chunk context handling
   - Add relevance feedback

4. **Features to Consider:**
   - Document preview/viewer
   - Export functionality
   - Batch operations
   - Advanced filtering
   - Collection sharing
   - Undo/redo operations

5. **Build/Distribution**
   - Configure electron-forge properly
   - Set up auto-updates
   - Handle large file processing
   - Optimize bundle size

6. **Architecture Decisions:**
   - IPC communication patterns
   - State management (if moving to React)
   - File storage strategy
   - Caching strategy

### Next Steps Priority
1. Decide on UI framework approach (React vs Hybrid)
2. Implement document preview functionality
3. Optimize vector similarity search
4. Add batch operations for collections
5. Improve error handling and user feedback
