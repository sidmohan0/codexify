## Making Changes

1. **Components**: New UI components should be added to `src/components/`

3. **AI Model**: Changes to embedding logic go in `model.js`
4. **Document Processing**: Update `document-processor.js` for new file types

### Best Practices

- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for API changes
- Follow the existing code style
- Keep changes focused and atomic

## Submitting Changes

1. Update your branch with main:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

2. Push your changes:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Steps to test
   - Related issues

## Style Guide

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```

2. Test types:

describe('Feature', () => {
  it('should work as expected', () => {
    // Your test here
  });
});
```
